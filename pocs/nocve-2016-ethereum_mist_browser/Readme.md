>The Mist browser is the tool of choice to browse and use Ðapps.


Summary 
-------

The ethereum mist comes with an integrated web-browsing functionality that allows for easy interaction with 3rd party Ðapps. This browser fails to properly protect the mist.api allowing a remote website to perform the following actions in the context of the mist process without the users consent:

* execute arbitrary shell commands
* delete arbitrary files
* create and read arbitrary shortcuts/links (includes overwriting files)
* de-anonymize the user in anonymous (unconnected) mode by leaking the main ethereum address (coinbase) including its balance, the mist application directory (leaks username on platform=windows) to the website

Leading to - at least - the following attack scenarios:

* client gets tricked / redirected (dns, mitm,...) or just browses a malicious website with mist ...
* [high risk, high impact] malicious website executes a shell command to download a reverse shell, executes it and now has full shell control of the client computer. This is the worst scenario allowing a website to completely take over the client application, stealing keys, installing keylogger, you name it.
* [high risk, high impact] malicious website overwrites links to point to a different location executing arbitrary commands next time the link is executed (e.g. plant a reverse shell, see prevs. scenario)
* [high risk, high impact] malicious websites deletes arbitrary files (platform, local path are leaked; permissions of mist process)
* [med risk, med impact] malicious websites de-anonymizes client even though it is not connected and mist suggests that you are browsing that Ðapp in an anonymous fashion by reading coinbase, mist.path infering the windows username from that folder.

Again, this is possible without user consent. 

Besides that, mist ...

* does not warn you when connecting to Ðapps/websites over insecure transports leaving mist vulnerable to MitM/passive sniffing attacks
* does not protect known critical sites like wallet.ethereum.org forcing a secure transport/HSTS/TLS pinning
* relies on a web-hosted default wallet that kind of is the single-point to exploit the majority of all ether holders. Hack that site, own many peers

and the wallet.ethereum.com Ðapp

* does not protect from framing attacks allowing scenarios like clickjacking
* has no feature of proving that is has not been tampered with (do we really trust that code?)

Proof of Concept
----------------

Prerequisites: 

* Browser -> navigate to https://tintinweb.github.io/pub/pocs/nocve-2016-ethereum_mist_browser/
* `MistPwn` website should be loaded and will provide some background information as well as a button to run some tests on whether your mist browser is still vulnerable. Upon clicking `I agree!` MistPwn will check if you are vulnerable to any of the issues raised above. It will show alerts right below the button to inform you of critical events and it will provide details for all the test run in the Results section. MistPwn wont execute any commands or remove/delete files unless it is instructed to do so. Whenever a potential harmful operation would be executed it will place a yellow button in the details section for you to check and perform that task manually. The PoC can be run in anonymous and connected mode.

This has been tested on windows 10 with latest mist (see top). A typical result would look like:

Alerts:

	info-leak    Mist leaks your local application directory: C:\Users\<MYUSER>\AppData\Local\Mist\app-0.8.6\resources\app.asar
	info-leak    You are leaking your local username to this website: <MYUSER>
	code exec    Mist exposes electron.shell - This website might execute arbitrary local commands without your consent (see details/testcase below).
	read write delete    This website might be able to read/write shortcut links or move files to trash
	info-leak    This website might be able to get your etherbase even though you are in anonymous mode: 0xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx (balance: 999999990000000000)

Results:

	TBD


Mitigation / Workaround / Discussion
-------------------------------------

* There's a need for trust/permission policies. The attack surfaces is comparable to mobile apps/browser extensions
* There's a need for transparency and user consent if an app performs critical actions (asks for information, wants to execute something, ..). Quite the same way as for transferring funds.
* Reconsider not exposing any backend-api directly (electron.shell). Mist should control all critical api.
* Ethereum is based on pseudonymity. Mist builds the connection between real world users and ethereum addresses that must be protected (e.g. mist suggests that you're anonymous until you connect, which is actually not true).

Notes
-----

* vendor fixed the high risk issues within one day of private disclosure!
* vendor released a fixed version [3] and advisory [3][4][6]
